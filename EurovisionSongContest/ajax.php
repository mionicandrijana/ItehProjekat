	   <h1>Press accreditation</h1>
	   <br>
	   <hr>
	   <p></p>
	     <p>The European Broadcasting Union considers the Press Accreditation (category P) to be a working tool to be used by media professionals only. This page describes the definition of a media professional.</p>
	     <br>
		 <p>GRANTING APPLICATIONS • The EBU and participating EBU Member broadcasters only provide accreditation to representatives of media which are available to the public in sales outlets, through publically accessible radio frequencies, television channels or internet sites. The media outlet should be registered at the Chamber of Commerce, or should be legally established otherwise.</p>
	     <br>
		 <p>DENYING APPLICATIONS • Publishers, marketing personnel, sub-editors, staff of the publications secretariat, advertising agency representatives, public relations agencies, students, Eurovision Song Contest fan publication producers, internal magazines of companies, trade magazines, and newsletters (or representatives of) one of the participating artists can not be accredited as press. However, at the sole discretion of the EBUs acting Head of Press, and where the quality and circulation criteria justify their consideration, such publications may be eligible for accreditation on a case by case basis.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>PRIORITY • A limited number of accreditations is available per participating country, based on the capacity of the Press Centre. It is the responsibility of the respective Head of Delegation or Head of Press to give out accreditations with priority to mass media, such as national daily newspapers, mass-circulation magazines, leading radio- and television stations, and popular internet portals.</p>

	   <h1>How can I take part?</h1><br>
            <hr>
            <p>In the lead up to the Eurovision Song Contest, national selections take place in the represented countries. These national selections are being organized by the respective national public broadcasters who are Active Members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). In the United Kingdom, the BBC is taking care of the national selection, in Sweden its SVT, in Germany its NDR, etc.
Good to know
First of all, it is important to know that the EBU is not involved in the national selections. It is entirely up to the participating broadcasters to decide how they pick their entry. However, the EBU does demand full transparency on the chosen procedure
    In most countries, televised national selections take place, and usually anyone can send in songs. A selection committee then picks the songs that will take part in the national selection, and a jury or viewers (or a mix of both) decide upon the winner
    Some broadcasters pick their entry for the Eurovision Song Contest internally. A selection committee then picks the representing artists, and sometimes also the song to be performed

Sending in your song

To take part in the Eurovision Song Contest, you need to win a national selection, or be selected by one of the participating broadcasters.

    Keep an eye on announcements made by your national public broadcaster. Usually, these announcements are made available through their website, and include details on how to send in your song
    Note that not all broadcasters accept songs from foreigh artists, song writers and composers
    If there is no public broadcaster in your country taking part in the Eurovision Song Contest, it is not possible to represent your country. To take part in the Eurovision Song Contest, you would have to enter your song for nomination in another country. Should you be selected to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest, you will then of course represent the respective country

Note that most broadcasters set their deadlines to submit songs somewhere between September and December.

If you sent in your song, the respective public broadcaster will inform you whether you have been selected for the national final, or not. From there, everything speaks for itself; you will have to win the national selection to represent the respective country at the Eurovision Song Contest.</p>';
