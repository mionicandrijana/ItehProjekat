Okey, we might be a bit biased but it's very close to the truth. In 2013 it'll be Malm&ouml; who will be hosting Europe's favourite decision</p></div></div><div class="body"><br><h2>How was Malm&ouml; chosen?</h2><br>
<p>The decision about the host city was open till the very last minute, SVT says. They received proposals from Stockholm and Malm&ouml;. "It was not really an easy decision," Martin &Ouml;sterdahl, Executive Producer of the 2013 contest says.</p>
<p>"We chose Malm&ouml; because there is a very good infrastructure and we have good experience of holding Melodifestivalen [the Swedish national selection] and the Eurovision Song Contest there," he explains. "The choice of Malm&ouml; is based on an overall assessment of the environment in which we think is best for the format of the Eurovision Song Contest, both in terms of TV shows and on the preparations."</p>
<p>"We are very pleased to have a Host City already at this stage. It shows the deep commitment SVT and the whole of Sweden have to host a great Eurovision Song Contest in 2013," says Jon Ola Sand, Executive Supervisor on behalf of the EBU. "We're confident Malm&ouml; will be a great host for next year's edition of Europe's favourite TV show."</p>
<p>The agreement means that SVT is responsible for all aspects related to TV shows and Malm&ouml; will support you with a comprehensive hosting service, logistics and events for the international press, the visiting fans and the participating delegations.</p>
<p>"Now the work starts on one of the biggest music shows in Europe to create an amazing event. We are obviously extremely proud and happy today," says Ilmar Reepalu, Mayor of Malmo.
						<p>By choosing Malm&ouml; and the Malm&ouml; Arena on Sunday, the groundwork for the Eurovision Song Contest has been laid. Christer Bj&ouml;rkman, one of the organisers, believes that an unforgettable world can be created around the event.</p>
<p>"By arranging the event in Malm&ouml;, we believe that we can create a Eurovision Song Contest in its true spirit, where focus lies with the heart and the artists. We are going to create a Eurovision world that will be an amazing experience for everyone that visits the city", he says.</p>
<p>"We know after several years of organising <em>Melodifestivalen</em> (the Swedish national selection) at the Malm&ouml; Arena that we can create an immensely good atmosphere there with all the emotions that we believe belong to the Eurovision Song Contest. Now we are incredibly charged to reach new creative heights with the shows".</p>

<p>Malm&ouml; is the third largest city in Sweden and one of the largest ones in Scandinavia with a metro population of 664,000 people. It has easy access to Denmark via the &Oslash;resund bridge which is the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe.</p>
<p>The city is part of the expanding &Ouml;resund region and is joined to Copenhagen in Denmark by the mighty, arching &Ouml;resund bridge.</p>
<p>For all the expansion, Malm&ouml; is a small, friendly city with a good choice of cultural attractions, including the new Moderna Museet Malm&ouml;. Look out for Malm&ouml;&rsquo;s many quality restaurants and bistros and great caf&eacute;s. And the shopping isn&rsquo;t bad either, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for Swedish design-ware and hip, new Swedish fashion labels.</p>
<p>Malm&ouml; has already hosted the contest once, back in 1992 after the Swedish pop-star Carola won the contest in 1991 with <em>F&aring;ngad Av En Stormvind.
